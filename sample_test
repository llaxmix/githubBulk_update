**Version 2.4**

Welcome to the full test template for the github md import feature of AEM. This document covers all the styles availalbe and how to implement.
Note: when loading github url into your page, it may take a number of tries to get the content to refresh. I am working with IT to resolve the bug. If you have just done an update in GitHub, it's best to wait for a few minutes to make sure you sync the latest version.

## Headers (H2)
Make sure you don't use the single # for any headers. Only the title of your article should be an H1. This isn't just a visual thing, this will impact your SEO score in google.
Always start with the ##.

### Sub header level 3 (H3)
#### Sub header level 4 (H4)
##### Sub header Level 5 (rarely used)
